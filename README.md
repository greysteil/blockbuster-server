## Setting up the repo
### Installing Packages
There is a requirements.txt file in the root of the repo which contains a list of the current package dependencies for the project.
You can automatically install all dependent packages using pip with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can upgrade packages to the latest versions with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`

If you do upgrade, remember to update requirements.txt with the new version (once confirmed working!).
You can use `pip freeze` to find out the versions of currently installed packages.
